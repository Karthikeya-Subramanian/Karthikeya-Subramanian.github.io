The title of this book encapsulates its essence. The word ``तत्त्व`` in this context signifies truth (``सत्यम्``), more specifically, the truth of the ``आत्मा``. The term ``बोधः`` refers to the knowledge of this truth, which is precisely what this text seeks to convey. Interestingly, ``तत्त्व`` can be split as ``तत् + त्वम्``, indicating the essence or the fundamental reality of ``तत्``—the ``आत्मा`` itself. 

This book was composed by an ``आचार्य`` from the Advaitic tradition and is considered an introductory text for seekers embarking on the path of self-inquiry and understanding Advaita Vedānta. Most Sanskrit texts follow a structured format—beginning with a ``मङ्गलश्लोक`` (auspicious invocation), followed by an introduction outlining the qualifications of a student, and then proceeding with the subject matter. ``तत्त्वबोधः`` adheres to this traditional format, specifically employing a question-and-answer style between the teacher and student.

### मङ्गलश्लोकः (Maṅgala Śloka)

> ``वासुदेवेन्द्रयोगीन्द्रं नत्वा ज्ञानप्रदं गुरुम्।``  
> ``मुमुक्षूणां हितार्थाय तत्त्वबोधो बिधीयते ॥``

We begin with salutations ``नत्वा``—traditionally offered to the Divine. Here, the reverence is directed toward the Guru, the one who bestows knowledge ``ज्ञानप्रदं गुरुम्``. The Guru, named ``वसुदेवेन्द्रयोगीन्द्र`` is acknowledged as a leader among yogis. With these salutations, we preach ``बिधीयते`` of ``तत्त्वबोधः``, that is ever-pure and good, written for those who ardently seek liberation ``मुमुक्षूणाम्``.

Now comes the requirements and qualifications for the process:

> ``साधनचतुष्टयसंपन्नाधिकारिणां मोक्षसाधनभूतं तत्त्वविज्ञानप्रकाशनं करिष्यामः``

One must be properly qualified (``अधिकारि``) for (``तत्त्व``) inquiry (``विचार``). In conclusion (``निदान``), this is equivalent to possessing ``साधनचतुष्टय`` and helps in distinguishing truth (``सत्य``) from the false (``मिथ्या``).

> ``अथ साधनचतुष्टयं किं ?``

The student asks the teacher: what are the four qualifications?

> * ``नित्य अनित्य वस्तु विवेकः``  
> * ``इहामुत्र फलभोग विरागः``  
> * ``शमादिषट्क संपत्तिः``  
> * ``मुमुक्षुत्वम्``  

These are the four qualifications for moksha. The student continues to inquire about these four technical terms:

> ``नित्य अनित्य वस्तु विवेकः कः ?``

What is permanent (``नित्य``) and impermanent (``अनित्य``), things (``वस्तु``), and how to distinguish (``विवेकः``)? The guru replies:

> ``नित्य वस्तु एकं ब्रह्म``  
> ``तद् व्यतिरिक्तं सर्वम् अनित्यम्``  

The only permanent thing is the truth/reality (``सत्``). Other than that (``व्यतिरिक्तं``) everything else is impermanent (``अनित्यम्``).

The student continues to inquire about:

> ``इहामुत्र फलभोग विरागः कः ?``

One must have detachment (``वैराग्यम्``) towards desires (``काम``). The guru expands:

> ``इहामुत्र फलभोगेषु वैराग्यम्``  

Often in Vedānta, there are mentions of rituals which will grant liberation. One mustn’t be deluded by these. One should not have attraction to these things (``काम``).

> ``शमादिषट्क संपत्तिः का ?``

The student asks about the six (``षट्``) possessions/wealth (``संपत्ति``) that one requires for liberation (``मोक्ष``).

The guru lists the six things:

> ``शमः, दमः, उपरति:, तितिक्षा, श्रद्धा, समाधानम्``

This structured dialogue between teacher and student makes ``तत्त्वबोधः`` an essential introductory text for Advaita Vedānta aspirants. In the next sections, we will explore more aspects of self-inquiry and realization.
