The title of this book encapsulates its essence. The word ``तत्त्व`` in this context signifies truth (``सत्यम्``), more specifically, the truth of the ``आत्मा``. The term ``बोधः`` refers to the knowledge of this truth, which is precisely what this text seeks to convey. Interestingly, ``तत्त्व`` can be split as ``तत् + त्वम्``, indicating the essence or the fundamental reality of ``तत्``—the ``आत्मा`` itself. 

This book was composed by an ``आचार्य`` from the Advaitic tradition and is considered an introductory text for seekers embarking on the path of self-inquiry and understanding Advaita Vedānta. Most Sanskrit texts follow a structured format—beginning with a ``मङ्गलश्लोक`` (auspicious invocation), followed by an introduction outlining the qualifications of a student, and then proceeding with the subject matter. ``तत्त्वबोधः`` adheres to this traditional format, specifically employing a question-and-answer style between the teacher and student.

### मङ्गलश्लोकः (Maṅgala Śloka)

> ``वसुदेवेन्द्रयोगीन्द्रं नत्वा ज्ञानप्रदं गुरुम्।``  
> ``मुमुक्षूणां हितार्थाय तत्त्वबोधो बिधीयते ॥``

We begin with salutations ``नत्वा``—traditionally offered to the Divine. Here, the reverence is directed toward the Guru, the one who bestows knowledge ``ज्ञानप्रदं गुरुम्``. The Guru, named ``वसुदेवेन्द्रयोगीन्द्र`` is acknowledged as a leader among yogis. With these salutations, we preach ``बिधीयते`` of ``तत्त्वबोधः``, that is ever-pure and good, written for those who ardently seek liberation ``मुमुक्षूणाम्``.
