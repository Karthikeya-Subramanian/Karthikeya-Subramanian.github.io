Most of us can probably relate to being fascinated by numbers at some point in our lives, especially a special group like prime numbers. They're mysterious, standing alone without any clear connection. As you delve into higher education, you'll come across algebraic and transcendental numbers, adding to the intrigue. 
But once you get past these sets of numbers, there's a vast category, likely including almost all real numbers, known as normal numbers.

Why use 'normal' in math when we talk about numbers? In math, 'normal' pops up everywhere â€” normal vectors, normal lines, normal spaces, and normal distributions (list goes on). When it comes to numbers, we call a number $'x'$ normal (written as $0.a_1a_2a_3\ldots$) if a group of k digits shows up just as much as any other group of k digits.

Let's clarify a bit. We're only interested in numbers after the decimal point, and by 'frequency,' you can think of it as being equally likely. For example, '1' should show up as often as '2,' '3,' '4,' '5,' '6,' '7,' '8,' '9,' and '0.' The same rule applies to something like '666,' which should appear as often as any other 3-digit number.

> A more mathematical definition for math fanatics out there is let $'x'$ be a number, Let s be a string of k digits , let $N_x(s,n)$ denote the number of times s appears in the first n digit of $'x'$ then $'x'$ is normal iff

$$ lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{N_x(s,n)}{n} = \frac{1}{10^k} $$

More natural question s to ask for an example. That's exactly what an undergraduate at Cambridge asked back in 1933, and he actually came up with one. It's now called the `Champernowne Constant` named after its creator, D.G. Champernowne.
$$ 0.1234567891011121314151617181920\ldots $$
