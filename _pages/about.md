 I'm a PhD student pursuing my doctoral studies at [IIIT - Bangalore](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/),in  Computation Topology under the guidance of [Dr. Amit Chattopadhyay](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty/amit-chattopadhyay). Beyond the world of academia, I find solace and joy in exploring the beauty of mountains, often capturing moments through my lens, a collection of which you can find on my [Captures](https://karthikeya-subramanian.github.io/portfolio/). I'm captivated by the world of numbers, exploring the subtle patterns of randomness and structures. Last one being a dead give away as I do work in Topology.

As I look to 2024, I've set a personal goal to share my thoughts and discoveries with you through monthly blog posts. These writings will be a glimpse into the ideas that fascinate me and fuel my intellectual curiosity. Come along on this journey as I delve into the intersection of academia, nature, and the intricate structures that weave through our universe.
